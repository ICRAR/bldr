About **bldr**
==================

**bldr** is a simple, straight-forward system that automates the process of building software packages from source with customisable configurations into self-contained, tagged and versioned modules. 

It has minimal requirements and will generally run on any BSD/Unix/Posix system that has GNU tools and BASH.

This system was written to help ease the burden of deploying software in HPC environments, and to avoid relying on arbitrary libraries, paths and environments which may interfere with performance critical code.
